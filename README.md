## DATA BANK SQL CHALLENGE

This is a sql project created by [Danny Ma]("https://www.linkedin.com/in/datawithdanny/") to help establish the foundational knowledge of sql while testing and developing logical problem skills.

For this case study, I chose to create my database with pgAdmin and then remotely connected this to Jupyter Notebooks. 

Before getting started, I would also recommend installing "ipython-sql". This allows you use the 'jupyter magic' function to interact with your relational database.
